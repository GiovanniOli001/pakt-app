Due to the generous free trial period, **all purchases are final and non-refundable**.

**Price:** $3.99 AUD (one-time payment, lifetime access)

## Exceptions

We will provide a full refund in the following circumstances:

### Technical Failure
If a bug, error, or technical issue with the App causes **permanent inability to access or use the service**, and we are unable to resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe (14 days), you are entitled to a full refund.

### Duplicate Purchase
If you accidentally purchased the App multiple times, we will refund the duplicate transactions.

### Unauthorised Purchase

## Australian Consumer Law
